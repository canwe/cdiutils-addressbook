CdiUtils AddressBook is a project which demonstrates the use of CDI 
(and CDI MVP / CDI Properties add-ons) in Vaadin projects.

The source originates from Vaadin Address Book -tutorial (https://vaadin.com/tutorial) 
but most parts of the project have been re-written to utilize CDI.

The classes under package org.vaadin.virkki.cdiutils.addressbook.ui.list contain most
of the documentation related to the changes.


CdiUtils AddressBook can be deployed to any JavaEE6 (Web Profile)-compatible container
(I've tested it on TomEE 1.5.2, Glassfish 3.1 and JBoss AS7).
